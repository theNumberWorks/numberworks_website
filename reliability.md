Many details about reliability, its role, the indexes that measure it, etc. are known in the scientific community. Still, there are many other details that are hardly know or applied. We try to advance the relevant use of reliability with our research projects.

<i class='fa fa-file'></i> See a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A3WPhX4lzv_L99vdn1-I_uPWgOOtYNJ0MQ-jjjScqgY/edit?usp=sharing) about some less known properties of reliability from the viewpoint of cognitive science.

## The relation of the reliability and the power of the hypothesis tests

The relation of the reliability and power is complex. On the one hand, it is well known that reliability attenuates the measured correlation, and, consequently, the power of the related hypothesis test. On the other hand, some robust cognitive (and other) phenomena are not reliable, termed the reliability paradox (e.g., [Hedge, Powell, Sumner, 2018](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0935-1)). This issue has been discussed and investigated in the literature. Here, I attempt to provide a more extensive, still accessible summary and explanation for the key relations between reliability and statistical power.
