Numerals are processed by a phylogenetically old analogue magnitude system. Can culturally new negative numerals be processed using this same representation? Using a comparison task we found that magnitude system is not used in a negative range, rather the sign of a number is processed by subsidiary processes. Our results reveal a
* **Sign shortcut strategy**. While comparing a positive and a negative number, only the sign of those numbers are considered without processing the values.
* **Mirroring mechanism**. Comparing two positive numbers is the usual comparison task. However when comparing two negative numbers, the negative sign is "cut", thus the two numbers now "mirrored" to the positive range are compared also on the magnitude system, and the answer (larger or smaller) is reversed.
